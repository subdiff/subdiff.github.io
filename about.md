Hi, thank you for visiting my incredible small yet unbelievable ambitious blog venture.

My name is Roman Gilg. I'm from Germany and I'm interested in many different things. Some of them I hope to put up on this blog.

My current life goals: For the next few months I'll primarily write on my master thesis in mathematics. Besides that I'm trying to get better at programming as a newcomer in practical terms.

I do some work for the [KDE project][kde] in order to achieve this.
